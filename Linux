How many subnets and hosts per subnet?
For example, in 11000000, the number 1s give us 2^2 subnets = 4 subnets.
The number of 0s gives us 2^6 â€“ 2 hosts
So, 64 - 2 = 62 hosts per subnet. You need to subtract 2 for the subnet address and broadcast address.

If 64 is the subnet number and 127 is the broadcast address, then 65-126 is the valid host range. 

Example 1: Class C 255.255.255.128 (/25)
Since 128 is 10000000 in binary, there is only 1 bit for subnetting and 7 bits for hosts.
192.168.10.0 = Network address
255.255.255.128 = Subnet mask
-How many subnets? Since 128 is 1 bit on (10000000), the answer would be 2 ^ 1 = 2 subnets.
-How many hosts per subnet? We have 7 host bits off (10000000), 2 ^ 7 â€“ 2 = 126 hosts.
-Valid subnets 256 - 128 = 128

Example 2: Class C 255.255.255.192 (/26)
To subnet the network address 192.168.10.0 using the subnet mask 255.255.255.192.
192.168.10.0 = Network address
255.255.255.192 = Subnet mask
-How many subnet? 128 + 64 = 192 => 2 bits So, 2^2 = 4 subnets
Hosts per subnet 2 ^ 6 = 64 - 2 = 62
Valid host 256 - 192 = 64
